## What is New
In general, the architecture of the whole codebase is refactored and a few bugs and errors are fixed by the way.


### engines
In engines, basic modules in the training pipeline are defined including data_preprocessor, trainer and evaluator.
1. data_preprocessor replaced the previous adaptation.py, i.e., selects the bands needed by an encoder and pads unavailable bands with zeros, and different augmentations.
2. trainer now support mixed precision/distributed training and print training stats and metrics in real time.
3. evaluator can be called independently and evaluate a model also in distributed way and compute per class metrics.
4. see run.py for how to assemble these modules and concatenate them

### datasets
1. The implementations are simplified and standardized (I try my best).
2. Dataset metas are read from configs, including newly added classes (name), ignore_index, and so on.
3.Mados, sen1floods, hlsburnscars, xView2, biomasster are supported by this branch currently.
4. To add (register) a new dataset implementation, use the decorator @DATASET_REGISTRY.register().

### foundation_models
1. Remove all irrelevant modules and functions used in pre-training. Only keep the essential modules in encoders for extracting features.
2. Support multi-stage output that may be needed by segmentors, specified by output layers in encoder config.
3. All the encoder should work properly.
4. To add (register) a new encoder implementation, use the decorator @ENCODER_REGISTRY.register().

### segmentors
1. Now the UperNet implementation is based on mmsegmentation, which is more likely correct: https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmsegmentation/tree/main
2. We can copypaste more segmentors later.
3. To add (register) a new encoder implementation, use the decorator @SEGMENTOR_REGISTRY.register().
4. So far, we have UPerNet for unitemporal semantic segmentation, UPerNetCD for change detection and MTUPerNet for multitemporal semantic segmentation
5. for multi-temporal, L-TAE and linear projection are supported

### Other comments
1. In the segmentor config, different losses, optimizers and schedulers can be picked (you have to define them in the respective utils file)

## What is still missing
1. Add the other datasets and foundation models following the existing examples in this codebase. Meanwhile, check the correctness of the original datasets before copypasting. [IMPORTANT]
2. More data augmentation need to be done. It wraps the dataset class by a configurable augmentor to perform both data preprocessing and augmentation. In this way, we avoid preprocessing data in the main process, which is slow.


## Setup
Should be the same as the v1 version of the code, maybe some dependencies can be removed


## Example
### Training: Single Temporal
Set `config`, `encoder_config`, `dataset_config`, `segmentor_config` and `augmentation_config` and start the training process on single gpu:
```
torchrun --nnodes=1 --nproc_per_node=1 run.py  \
--config configs/run/default.yaml  \
--encoder_config configs/foundation_models/prithvi.yaml  \
--dataset_config configs/datasets/mados.yaml   \
--segmentor_config configs/segmentors/upernet.yaml \
--augmentation_config configs/augmentations/segmentation_default.yaml  \
--num_workers 4 --eval_interval 1  --use_wandb
```

### Training: Multi Temporal
Multi-temporal model `configs/segmentors/upernet_mt.yaml` should be used. In addition, in the dataset config, indicate the number of time frames, e.g., `multi_temporal: 6`
```
torchrun --nnodes=1 --nproc_per_node=1 run.py  \
--config configs/run/default.yaml  \
--encoder_config configs/foundation_models/prithvi.yaml  \
--dataset_config configs/datasets/croptypemapping.yaml   \
--segmentor_config configs/segmentors/upernet_mt.yaml \
--augmentation_config configs/augmentations/segmentation_default.yaml  \
--num_workers 4 --eval_interval 1 --use_wandb
```

### Evaluation
```
torchrun --nnodes=1 --nproc_per_node=1 run.py --batch_size 1 --eval_dir work-dir/the-folder-where-your-exp-is-saved
```

All of these parameters can also be set in the run config file.

To use more gpus or nodes, set `--nnodes` and `--nproc_per_node` correspondingly, see:
https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/elastic/run.html

To use mixed precision training, specify either `--fp16` for float16 and or `--bf16` for bfloat16

For fine-tuning instead of linear probing, specify `--finetune`.
